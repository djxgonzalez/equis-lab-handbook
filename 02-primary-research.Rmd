# Primary Research and Writing

You have a sound study design and consensus among your team about the the study methods. Now it's time to do the primary analyses and write up your findings. Again, the *how* of doing your research is outside the scope of this Handbook. In this section, I make suggestions for staying organized and working efficiently.

## Set up your data science project

You have a lot of decisions to make as a researcher. Rather than the quotidian logistics of managing a data science project--what name to give a file, where to export your data--I'd like you to focus on the intricacies of study design and data analysis. In that spirit, here I describe my data science project management system.

If you or your lab group already have a system for setting up data projects—-great. If you'd like to take this system as a starting point to iterate on—-fantastic, I encourage it!

### Naming projects

Each project gets it's own directory (aka folder), and each of those directories needs a name. I try to keep things simple and consistent, so I use this basic convention for naming projects: Setting-Exposure-Outcome. For example, a project where the setting is California, the exposure is wildfire smoke, and the outcome is preterm birth, I would name the directory: `cal-wildfiresmoke-ptb`.

### Naming files

I like to keep file names short and simple. If you follow the above strategy, then information about the project is already conveyed in the directory structure itself. Also, there's no need to write specific names for documents every project has, like the manuscript or supplementary materials. I keep these filenames simple, e.g., `manuscript01` or `supplementary01`. With each iteration, you can simply go to the next draft number. I.e., the second draft would be `manuscript02`. When you ask co-authors for feedback, they can add their initials at the end of the filename (e.g., `manuscript02-abc-xyz`). When you're ready to you incorporate co-author feedback, you can again simply move on to the next number (`manuscript03`).

## Manage your code

[brief intro]

### Tool: Style Guide

A style guide is a system for writing consistent and readable code, including syntax, layout, and naming conventions for functions and objects. Again, the goal is to reduce the number of logistical decisions you need to make so you can focus on your research. You don't need to invent your own system, but you should feel free to iterate on the existing ones. I use [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html){target="_blank"} to style my R code, and there are other options out there, including the [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html){target="_blank"}. Other languages have their own style guides, such as the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/){target="_blank"}.

### Tool: GitHub Repo

Git is a system for... [describe]. GitHub is a platform for... [describe]

This is helpful for several reasons: 
- Version control, so you can go back to older versions of your code if you need to.
- Code sharing with your team, so that a collaborator on another machine can read and edit your code.
- Open data science, so you can publish and share your code with the world to accompany your eventual paper.

You can use the command line to access GitHub (here's a [tutorial]()), or simply download and use the [GitHub Desktop]() app.

## Write as you go

I encourage my students to work incrementally and write as they go. There are a few advantages to this.

### Keep good notes

Keep using the project log you started in the Iterative Study Design stage. Update the *Meta* section as needed (e.g., add new co-authors or datasets) and track decisions in the *Daily Log*.

### Outline the manuscript

If you wrote a high level outline, you already have a starting point for your manuscript. You can directly turn the high level outline into a manuscript outline, add the results and discussion sections, and edit the tenses (e.g., change "we will do xyz" to "we did xyz"). As you do your analyes--maybe while waiting for a script to run--you can work on the manuscript outline.

### Finalize your first draft

Once you're down with your analyses... [expand]

If you haven't already, decide on which journal you'd like to submit to first. This is a decision you should make with your adviser, with input from your co-authorship team. It's not a bad idea to also choose second and third choice journals (and beyond), in the not unlikely scenario that your paper is rejected. Once you have your target journal, make sure to carefully read the journal's Author Guide, which describes their requirements for formatting, word limits, etc.

### Tool: Reference Manager

You're probably using one of these already. References managers like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/){target="_blank"}, [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/){target="_blank"}, [EndNote](https://endnote.com/){target="_blank"}, and [PaperPile](https://paperpile.com/){target="_blank"} (my favorite) help you organize your reading, make highlights, and take notes. Integrate your reference manager with your word processor so you can drop in-text citations, automatically generate a list of literature cited, and instantly change the citation format for different journals. The UC Berkeley Library has more information on reference managers [here](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/publichealth/citations){target="_blank"}.
