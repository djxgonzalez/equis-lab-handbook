This Handbook assumes you’ve already defined your research question, at least broadly. But how do you develop a good research question in the first place? This is one of the more difficult skills to learn in the environmental health sciences, and it’s outside the scope of this Handbook to go into depth on this topic. [expand] This is a major reason we work in teams, so we can co-develop ideas… 2.1 Tools At this early stage of the project, I suggest using the following tools to organize your thinking and get feedback from colleagues. 2.1.1 Project Log I find it helpful to have a way to organize project-specific notes and tasks, located in an area with the . This could take many forms, such as task management software, a Word document, or a paper journal. I prefer to use a simple text document with basic Markdown script. I don’t usually share this document. It’s just a designated place to keep track of my coding decisions (e.g., why I decided to go with one R package instead of another), data provenance (e.g., linking to the website I got a particular shapefile from), and where I left off at the end of the work session so I know right where to pick up when I return to the project. I organize the project log into two section: Meta and the Daily Log. The Meta section includes: Project Information, including the list of Authors with full names, affiliations, email addresses, and ORCIDs. This is helpful when submitting the paper to a journal, as they typically require this information for all co-authors. I also list Presentations, such as conferences, including upcoming conferences I want to submit to with abstract deadlines and/or presentations previously presented at. Sometimes journals ask for this information at the time of submission, so it’s good to keep this hand as well. Journal Information Data Tasks The Daily Log section includes an entry for each day spent working on the project. Each entry is typically bullet points capturing information I might want to refer back to at some point in the future. Some examples of useful information to record include: Decisions made today regarding which datasets to use Decisions on target journals and rationale Decisions on methodological approaches Major updates to the project codebase Correspondence with colleagues Notes from team meetings Abstracts submitted Ideas for figures Iasks completed [Project Log template] 2.1.2 High Level Outline This tool comes from Luby and Southern (2023), The Pathway to Publishing: A Guide to Quantitative Writing in the Health Sciences, and is a helpful organizing document for both the writer and anyone reviewing the document. In this document, the writer briefly summarizes the study’s context, the gap it addresses, and its objectives. The writer also concisely describes the study design, data, and methods, outlines tables and figures, and anticipates strengths, limitations, and prospective findings and conclusions. As described by Luby and Southern: “The role of the high level outline is to sketch out the major components of the manuscript that will support the data analysis included in the framing document [another writing tool suggested by Luby and Southern]. This is an outline,that should be no longer than 1500 words (excluding the tables, figures and references). Full sentences are not necessary. “Keeping the document short helps the author focus on the key elements of the manuscript, and provides early high level input. Because a short document takes less time for authors to produce and less time for co-authors to review, it generates prompt feedback on key ideas, and so supports a faster path to publication. Using this approach prevents authors investing weeks or months developing full draft manuscripts, that are off target with pages and pages of prose that need to be discarded.” I highly recommend reading Luby and Southern (2023) to learn more about their approach to scientific writing and to see templates of the high level outline and other writing tools. 2.1.3 Memos In the context of applied data science, by memo I mean a self-contained RMarkdown document that poses and answers a set of questions related to the project. I find this particularly helpful at early stages of a project, such as conducting exploratory analyses of environmental datasets, for example summarizing data on daily particulate matter concentrations, from a monitoring network, or testing out code to carry out a basic data science task, such as assigning particulate matter exposures to a patient population. 2.1.4 Reference Manager Cultivating your readings/references is a fundamental research skill. There are several options to choose from, with some degree of cross-compatibility among them. I use PaperPile, and other commonly used software includes Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote. You can learn more about Reference Managers at this website from the UC Berkeley Library. 2.2 Workflow 2.2.1 Capture your ideas 2.2.2 Conduct exploratory analyses 2.2.3 Get feedback Ideally you have a network of formal mentors ready to provide feedback, including your adviser and other members of your lab group. Also: community partners 2.2.4 Iterate Revise your high level outline Do more exploratory analyses Talk to your colleagues Read the literature, and pay attention to the methods and findings Methods to build on? Hypotheses to follow up opn? 2.3 Setting up your project directory 2.3.1 Naming projects [Brief Intro] Each project gets it’s own directory, and each of those directories needs a name. I try to keep things simple, so I use this basic convention for naming projects: Setting-Exposure-Outcome. For example, a project where the setting is the, the exposure is wildfire smoke, and the outcome is preterm birth (PTB), I would name the directory: cal-wildfiresmoke-ptb. 2.3.2 Naming files I think it’s best to keep this simple. If you follow the above strategy, then information about the project is already conveyed in the file structure itself. There’s no need to write specific names for universal documents, like the manuscript or supplementary materials. I keep these filenames simple, e.g., manuscript01 or supplementary01. With each iteration, you can simply increment the numerical suffix. The second draft of the manuscript can be manuscript02. Co-authors can add their initials at the end of the document (e.g., manuscript02-abc-xyz), and when you address their suggestions you can simply move on to the next iteration (manuscript03). 2.3.3 Organizing your directory I use a standard [insert an image here showing directory tree] 2.3.4 Resources You can download a full template for my research project structure here, including templates for the Concept Note and Project Log.
