# Publication and Outreach {#publication}

Congratulations! You're about to be a published author. Make sure you share the good news with your co-authorship team. 

That said, your job's not over yet. Accepted papers don't get published immediately and a few steps remain.

## Getting from accepted to published

After a journal accepts your paper, you'll need to do a few more tasks to get to a publication-ready article:

- Review galley proofs [describe]. Respond to any questions from journal editorial staff. Verify all of the authors' names are spelled correctly and that everyone is matched with the right institutional affiliation. Finally, give your manuscript one last proofreadâ€”-once typos are published, they're permanent!
- If you'd like to get news coverage for your article, ask the journal to set an embargo date. An embargo date is...

## Open access publishing

### Open access and article processing charges

[Describe what open access is, different models]
Article processing charge (APCs) , many journals require this for open access; ]
This process has also been evolving in recent years, as...
It is a good sentiment to make science open accesss... Some popular, for-profit publishing firms, however, charge [high] fees... which can be a drain on already constrained scientific funding, particularly for researchers from under-resourced institutions.

### Alternatives to paying for open access

The costs of open access can be prohibitively expensive, and fortunately there are other ways for your paper to be freely available to the public:

- **Preprint Servers** - Many journals will allow you to post your accepted manuscript to a preprint server. The accepted manuscript is the final draft of your submission to a journal after peer review has been done, but before it has been professionally formatted (so it's usually a Word document). If you've already uploaded an earlier draft of your manuscript to the preprint server, you can update it with the final accepted manuscript.
- **Institutional Repositories ** - Many universities maintain their own repositories where you can upload your work and receive a permanent link, which is valuable for citing and sharing your work. Researchers affiliated with UC can upload accepted manuscripts to eScholarship.
- **Personal Websites** - You're often allowed to upload a PDF of your manuscript to your own personal website without restriction.
- **Open Access Journals** - Some journals, such as the [NIEHS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/){target="_blank"}-funded *[Environmental Health Perspectives](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/){target="_blank"}*, are open access by default and don't charge an APC.

Before you upload your manuscript, make sure to check the journal's policies to see what kind of sharing is allowed.

## Sharing your paper

### Get organized

Things to assemble:
- Photos or other visuals, communications staff and journalists often ask for this. You can be a published author *and* photographer!
- Key points that you'd like to make sure you covney to all of the media and communications professionals you work with. If your paper is newsworthy, you're probably going to get similar questions from multiple people. Make sure to provide a consistent message.

Coordinate with journal outreach staff. Many journals promote their new publications via their websites and social media channels. You can share your handles and highlights


### Working with communications staff at your institution

Your institution may have an office (or several offices) devoted to sharing new research. For example, UC Berkeley Public Health News... 

Communications staff can:
- Write a press release
- Help you prepare for media interviews

Check with the communications staff at your university for specifics.

### Working with journalists

If journalists reach out to you requesting an interview, it's important to take the time to prepare. Read your paper again to refresh your memory. Make a list of key points you want to convey. If a finding was unexpected or surprised you, be prepared to talk about it. And of course, reach out to your mentors and ask their advice. 

You can also to take a basic media training course. The [Science Communication Network](https://sciencecommunicationnetwork.org/){target="_blank"} provides resources for scientists and health professionals to improve public outreach skills and connects journalists with environmental health experts.

If you're affiliated with a research institution, you might have access to a media and communications office, with professional staff who can help you in your science outreach. At UC Berkeley, students, staff, and faculty can access a [Media Training for Academics](https://news.berkeley.edu/media-training){target="_blank"} course offered by the Office of Communications and Public Affairs and the Greater Good Science Center.
