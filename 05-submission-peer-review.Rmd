# Submission and Peer Review {#submission}

Your manuscript and all other materials are finalized. Now you're ready to submit!

## Before you submit

### Double-check the author guide

Make sure the manuscript is properly formatted.

### Write a cover letter

Cover letters are an opportunity to describe to the journal's editors what your manuscript adds to the literature and a why it's good fit for their journal. [expand]

Some journals require cover letters, some do not. 

### Assemble your materials

Manuscript
Tables and figures
Supplementary information
Meta data for the study

If you've followed the steps in this Handbook, you should already have most of the information the journal will ask for in your Project Log.

Conflicts of interest declaration

Journals will typically ask that you suggest peer reviewers.

## Submitting to a journal


Typically, the system will generate a PDF proof with all of your materials. Give it one final look, verify that everything is there that you uploaded the correct drafts, properly formatted. If everything looks good--hit submit.

Congratulations!

Send an email update to your co-authors, attach the auto-generated PDF proof, and let them know you'll keep them in the loop about the journal's decision.

## Types of editorial decisions

* **Desk rejection.** The editors made a decision to reject your paper without sending it on to peer reviewers. Sorry. This is common, don't sweat it, just move on and submit to the next journal on your list!
* **Rejection after peer review.** The editor thought your paper was fit to send to peer reviewers, but after receiving those reviews, decided to reject the paper. Sorry, again, not uncommon at all. Ideally you'll be able to see the comments from the peer reviewers, which you can bring to your team and decide whether and how to address them before re-submitting or submitting to a different journal.
* **Revise and re-submit.** [expand] Below I discuss strategies to address reviewer comments.
* **Accepted.** Congratulations! Typically, you'll need to go through several rounds of revisions before you reach this stage. It is very rare for papers to be accepted without revisions, but it does happen.

## Addressing reviewer comments

Every comment needs to be addressed. Take a professional and respectful tone, even if the comments themselves are not. It's common, but not necessary, to thank reviewers for their suggestions.

As you respond to comments, make it easy for the editors and peer reviewers by saying where you made changes and what you changed text to.You don't have to agree with everything the the reviewer suggested. [expand]
